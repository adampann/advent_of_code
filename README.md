# Advent of Code

The real holiday that nerds care about. 25 days to Christmas? No thank you, give me stressful leetcode questions that are disguised as fun stories.
If I was only going for speed of completion then I'd do it all in python but that isn't as fun and I don't think I'd learn as much with that. So instead I'll try to use some other languages. I've wanted a reason to try learning Go & Rust. This might be a good way to do it.

## Structure 

I'm setting this repo up as if I'm going to 1. Complete it in multiple languages per day & 2. Complete multiple years (unlikely but lets stay positive ❤️)
But to set myself up for success I'll be adding each year then each language with the given says inside of it.


## Notes

If you are reading this... WOW nice, hi how are you? Hope you enjoy what you are seeing and know that this was all done using neovim (because I'm super cool)
